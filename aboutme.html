<h1>About Me!</h1> 
<p>I am a junior at the <a href="https://umaine.edu/"> University of Maine </a>	 and I am majoring in business with a minor in Earth Sciences. I live in southern Maine (Gray). I am 20 years old, going on 21 at the end of March. My dream is to work in a jewelry store either as a clerk or a bench jeweler. I love rocks and gems, and I have an extensive collection.</p>
