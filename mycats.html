   <h1>Skidder </h1>  
<p>Skidder is a maine coon cat. He is named after a ski trail at my favorite mountain resort, Sugarloaf. He's about four years old and loves to run around the house at full speed. He's a strictly indoor cat, as we live in a wooded area and we don't want him to get eaten by a coyote, owl, fisher, or anything for that matter! The picture below is from when he was a kitten!</p>

<h1>Mickey </h1>  

<p>Mickey was the cat I grew up with. He was a very large boy, weighing at 34 lbs at his heaviest! He was an indoor/outdoor cat, and he loves to explore around our house and yard.He was originally my grandmother's neighbor's cat, but when she passed away, we took him home (I was about 3). He passed away when I was 16. He was the best cat anyone could ask for. </p>
